            <h2><br>THE RED PLANET</h2>
            <p> <br>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. It  is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. 
                <br><br>Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU. <br><br> 
                One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days. <br> <br>

            <h2><br>TWO MOONS</h2>
            <p> <br>Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos <br>Mars' moons are among the smallest in the solar system. Phobos is a bit larger than Deimos, and orbits only 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) above the Martian surface. No known moon orbits closer to its planet. It whips around Mars three times a day, while the more distant Deimos takes 30 hours for each orbit. Phobos is gradually spiraling inward, drawing about six feet (1.8 meters) closer to the planet each century. Within 50 million years, it will either crash into Mars or break up and form a ring around the planet. <br><br></p>

            <h2><br>MANY MISSIONS</h2>
        <p><br><br>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system , and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.<br><br>NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. <br><br>At this time, Mars' surface cannot support life as we know it. Current missions are determining Mars' past and future potential for life.</p>

      <h2><br>IS THERE WATER ON MARS?</h2>
      <p><br>Is there water on Mars? There sure is! It’s not exactly like water on Earth, but Martian H20 can tell us a lot about the planet’s distant past while potentially aiding explorers in the future. <br><br></p>

    <br> <h2>A BETTER PERSPECTIVE <br><br></h2>
    <p>From its blood-like hue to its potential to sustain life, Mars has intrigued humankind for thousands of years. Learn how the red planet formed from gas and dust and what its polar ice caps mean for life as we know it. <br><br></p>
