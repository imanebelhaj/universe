<h2>HOME, SWEET HOME</h2>
<br>
<p> While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.<br>

        <h2>WE'RE ON IT</h2>
        <p> <br>Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface.<br>
         Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. <br></p>

        
        <p> Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity,<br> but for at least a thousand years,
          some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,”<br> which means simply “the ground.”<br></p>
